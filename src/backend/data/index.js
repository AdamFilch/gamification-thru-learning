We will start with a minor introduction to artificial intelligence in which we will know what is artificial intelligence with the help of examples. Moving ahead we will see what are the uses of AI, what is strong AI and what is weak AI. We will warp up this video by making you understand the major difference between AI ML and Deep Learning which will be followed by the future scope of artificial intelligence. ",
